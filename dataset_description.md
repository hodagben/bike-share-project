# Description of Dataset
1. Vancouver Bike Share, Inc., “Mobi”: Data concerning bike ridership in our time window of January 1, 2017 - April 30, 2024. The relevant data provided by Mobi includes, for each bike ride, the
  * Departure and return times (precision to the hour’s ‘floor’),
  * Distance of the ride (m),
  * Duration of the ride (sec),
  * Departure and return temperatures (in degrees C),
  * Whether or not the ride was on an electric bike (“e-bike”)


2. Environmental and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) database, the Government of Canada: Historical weather data from the above time window, measured at the weather station at Vancouver International Airport, which takes more weather measurements than other weather stations in the Vancouver area. The measurements included in each observation from the data we examine
  * The date and hour,
  * Temperature (degrees C),
  * Dew point temperature (degrees C),
  * Relative humidity percentage, which is the percentage of water vapor in the air present relative to the maximum amount possible,
  * The direction of the maximum wind gust (in tens of degrees, measured from true north), recorded only if this gust exceeds 29 km/hr
  * The wind speed of the maximum wind gust (km/hr), recorded only if exceeding 29 km/hr,
  * Visibility (km),
  * Wind chill temperature (degrees C), an index combining temperature and wind velocity to describe how cold the weather feels to the average person,
  * The atmospheric pressure (in kPa) at the weather station’s elevation,
  * A description of the weather; e.g., “Clear,” “Cloudy,” “Rain”, taken every three hours,
  * Minimum, maximum, and mean temperature of that day (degrees C),
  * Heating degree days (degrees C) of that day, which is the number of degrees the day’s mean temperature is below 18 degrees Celsius,
  * Cooling degrees day (degrees C) of that day, which is the number of degrees the day’s mean temperature is above 18 degrees Celsius,
  * The total rain (mm) in that day,
  * The total snow (cm) in that day,
  * The total precipitation (mm) in that day,
  * The amount of snow on the ground that day (cm),
  * The speed of the maximum gust of wind for that day (km/hr), recorded only if this gust exceeds 31 km/hr
  * For further information on the definition of these weather and climate terms, see [ECCC's Glossary](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/glossary_e.html).
